# 🩺 Heart Disease Prediction – Machine Learning Pipeline  

## 📖 Project Overview  
This project applies a **comprehensive machine learning pipeline** to the **UCI Heart Disease dataset**.  
The goal is to analyze risk factors, predict heart disease, and explore hidden patterns using both **supervised** and **unsupervised** learning techniques.

## 🎯 Key Features  
- **Data Preprocessing & Cleaning** (missing values, encoding, scaling, EDA)  
- **Dimensionality Reduction** with PCA  
- **Feature Selection** (RFE, Chi-Square, Feature Importance)  
- **Supervised Models:** Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, SVM  
- **Unsupervised Models:** K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering  
- **Model Optimization:** GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV  
- **Model Export:** Save trained models as `.pkl`  
- *(Bonus)* Streamlit UI for real-time predictions  
- *(Bonus)* Deployment using Ngrok
